### Player Controller
A top-down character controller with IK implementations to incorporate better animations and realitic player movement
The project it's taken from is focused very much on character movement and use of IK alow for that grownded character movement

I learned a lot while developing character controller for my Top-Down Stealth project, including the proper use of vector maths for implementing character controller
with respecte to an Isometric camera setup and using IK to utilize mutliple animation at the same time on different layers of the character.

This script hold the core mechanics of my top-down stealth project, and it depicts my skill at creating dynamic and complex character controllers
